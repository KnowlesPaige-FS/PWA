# PWA

The Programming for Web Applications course continues teaching technologies used for creating dynamic content for the web. Students in this course will learn how to create an API, document its use, and perform unit testing. They will explore common design patterns to manage sessions and enhance redundancy by decoupling and scaling server-side applications using discrete, modular services that allow for more flexibility.
